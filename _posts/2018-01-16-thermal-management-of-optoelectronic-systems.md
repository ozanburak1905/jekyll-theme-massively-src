## Thermal management of opto/electronic systems
The semiconductor industry is committed to follow Moore’s law to meet the consumer’s demand for high performance computing.  As the dissipated power density increases due to the increasing number of transistors, cooling becomes a significant problem.  Considering that thermal related issues are the leading failure cause, thermal management is a problem that is to be addressed using a holistic approach; using improved chip architectures, transistor design, packaging solutions, cooling solutions, board, chassis and data center designs. 

### Thermal Packaging

One of the main functions of the package of an electronic system is thermal management.  The heat generated in the die of a CPU is dissipated through the package components, thermal interface material (TIM) and integrated heat spreader (IHS), where it is dissipated to ambient air by using a heat sink.  Defects in the TIM layer acts an additional thermal resistance along the cooling path and will have a significant impact on the cooling performance.  Package assembly process must be optimized to prevent defects in the TIM and ensure that the package cooling performance satisfies targeted thermal specifications.  The assembly process recipe is developed for a given product during assembly process development, where a large number of test units are built and tested.  Imaging techniques are used to identify the defects during the assembly process development to understand the causes of defects and optimize the assembly process parameters.  In our research we have shown theoretically through numerical experiments that thermal tomography is a powerful tool for imaging defects that can be used instead of methods such as CSAM or x-ray imaging that are expensive to implement.  Our research in this field is ongoing. 

### Improved cooling performance

Enhancing the cooling solution performance has been a concern for the electronics industry.  There are three building blocks where improvement is possible: 

1. Spreading:  Heat dissipated though a small die must be spread to the cooling solution that has a larger form factor.  Passive/active phase change systems, active single phase systems or solid blocks can be used for spreading or remote cooling.  Passive phase change spreaders have been the preference among all, as they do not include any moving parts such as a pump that is prone to reliability concerns.  Our research has shown that using specially designed boiling/evaporation and condensation enhancement structures and engineered fluids, spreading performance of passive phase change devices can significantly improved. 
1. Heat removal:  Improving the heat removal rate to ambient air is possible by various heat transfer enhancement techniques.  Many low powered systems have been relying on free convection.  With increasing heat dissipation rate in these components, an air mover must be employed.  Piezo electric fan integrated cooling systems can be used as an alternative to axial fans that consume more battery power, noisy and expansive.  Novel designs are produced to address the usage of piezo electric fan integrated cooling systems. 
1. Refrigeration:  Thermoelectric integrated heat sinks can significantly improve air cooling performance for high power dissipating electronics components at their maximum design power.  The required refrigeration power of a correctly designed system will be reasonable on the contrary to the common perception; moreover, it will be minimal for idle power. 

On the other hand, significant research effort have also been focusing on low cost, low noise, low impact cooling solutions based on demands from the industry on this end.
