Project topics are available for motivated graduate students that have good written and oral communication skills.  Undergraduate students with extra motivation are also welcome. 

### Optical characterization of nano-structures:
The goal of this research is to investigate characterization of nanometer sized structures using optical methods.  Characterization of nano-structures has been of interest for a large variety of applications from nano-manufacturing to combustion diagnosis.  In this study we are focusing on defining the size and geometric configuration of the nano-particle aggregates by using light scattering experiments.  This is currently an ongoing project and we have been working on identifying soot aggregates using light experiments without ex-citu measurements.  While we have shown that the problem can be formulated as an inverse problem and solved by various deterministic gradient based or global search algorithms, we have recently introduced the use of artificial intelligence (AI) via Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) for the solution of the problem.  We would like to pursue further avenues using AI in collaboration with faculty in Computer Engineering department, while we introduce more complexities to the problem for more accurate representation of the physical system considered.  The study will be the continuation of recent MS graduate Ozan Ericok’s research.  Please see Ozan Ericok’s publications (in the publications link) for more information on this topic. 

An ideal student should have a strong background or must be interested in learning more on: 
1.  Radiative transfer
1.  Physics (optics, electromagnetics)
1.  Applied mathematics/numerical methods, artificial learning
1. Using related open source research software
1. Programming


### Design of nano-structured coatings with spectral alteration:
Spectral absorption, emission, or transmission behavior of coatings can be altered using nano-structures.  We have been considering multi layered or pigmented systems for optical tuning of coatings, filters or emitters for various applications such as solar thermal systems, PV or TPV systems (please see our relevant publications).  Using phase change materials such as vanadium dioxide or its alloys that exhibit metallic or dielectric behavior can be used for developing smart coating designs to achieve coatings with desired radiative properties.  The objective of this research is extend our existing know-how in sprectrally selective coating design for designing coatings relying on phase change materials.  Please see Refet Yalcin and Farhad Kazemi’s publications (in the publications link) for more information on this topic.

### Non-destructive thermal characterization of embedded objects:
Identification of embedded objects are of interest for many different applications such as biomedical imaging or nondestructive testing. Tomography techniques based on electromagnetic or acoustic waves have been widely used for such problems. A solution is also possible by using heat as signal and temperature measurements.  The study will be continuation of Bahar Oner’s study. 

An ideal student should have a strong background or must be interested in learning more on: 
1.  Heat transfer (especially conduction)
1.  Programming
1.  Applied mathematics, numerical methods
1.  Open/commercial CHT/CFD software (or develop model)
