## Nano-technology applications for renewable energy systems
Use of renewable energy sources offers an opportunity for cleaner environment and sustainable development.  Specially designed meta-materials with enhanced properties can be used to maximize the efficiency of these systems by improving energy harvesting and transfer capability.  These materials and systems rely on nano-meter size structures or particles, and there are challenges in understanding the behavior of these systems in nano-metric length scales, designing, and manufacturing such systems.  One of our goals is to develop design and modeling tools for such materials, systems.  The inverse design for optically tuned or spectrally selective coatings for solar applications is investigated in this realm.  We also try to experimentally validate these tools.  In one of our current projects we are trying to experimentally prove the enhancement of radiative transfer due to near field effects in nano-metric gaps in collaboration with other institutions in İstanbul. 

This is an ongoing research program, and more information will be posted soon.
