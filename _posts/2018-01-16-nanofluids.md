## Nanofluids
Heat transfer enhancement has been an interest of thermal engineers for many decades with many recent applications from electronics cooling to energy conversion systems.  It can be shown that heat transfer performance a thermal or energy system can be greatly enhanced by using engineered fluids enriched with nano-particles.  The colloidal suspensions of nano-particles of a relatively conductive material such as a metal or ceramic and a base fluid are usually referred as nano-fluids and it was observed that nano-fluids have improved thermal properties with respect to the base fluid used.  Our goal is to characterize these fluids and fully understand the flow and heat transfer properties so that potential applications can be identified and cooling systems relying on these fluids can be designed. 
 

### Experimental Work:
We have been investigating production hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanofluids based on water, ethylene glychol (EG), and water/EG (50%) via two step method using ultrasonication and surfactant use. It has been observed that the thermal conductivity of the base fluid can be increased significantly even for very dilute suspensions while the viscosity increase is relatively lower. Moreover, our experimental work focuses on laminar forced convection of hBN-water nanofluids to identify the enhancement in the convective heat transfer coefficient.

### Microscopic modeling:
Molecular dynamics is a powerful tool for understanding the governing physical mechanisms by modeling the small scale systems simulating the interactions in atomic levels. We have been working on modeling hBN-water nanofluids in order to understand heat transfer enhancement mechanisms. Boron nitride exists in different crystal structures and its hexagonal form exhibits a strong orthotropic behavior due to its layered hexagonal crystal structure very similar to that of graphite. Molecular dynamics simulations rely on intermolecular potentials to model the behavior of different materials correctly. Considering that there was a need to develop interlayer potentials for hBN, and hBN and water, we have been working on developing interlayer potentials for hBN and potentials for hBN-water. Once these are both established, thermal conductivity of hBN-water nanofluids will be investigated considering different enhancement mechanisms.

### Macroscopic modeling:
Design and analysis of equipment is necessary in order to investigate the use of nanofluids for different applications.  While this is possible by macroscopic modeling techniques relying on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational heat transfer (CHT), simple flow solvers considering the nanofluid as a single phase fluid considering effective properties underestimate the performance, often by large errors.  Moreover, they are not able to predict the increase in the convective heat transfer coefficient and friction factor.  Therefore, either two phase models that necessitate significantly large computational power or improved single phase models must be used.  Our research group have been investigating these techniques, identifying the error margins, and propose improvements to the existing techniques. 

### Applications:
From an engineering point of view, objective of developing and investigating nanofluids is to improve performance in various applications.  Therefore, on this front we have been investigating possible applications, and trying to identify capability limits for different nanofluids by optimizing the nanofluid for the particular application.  The applications we are focusing on in regards to nano-fluids is mainly related to energy harvesting, and thermal management; in particular we are working on direct solar absorption systems, electronics cooling, and vehicle thermal management.
